## Tier

## Type
feature

## Priority
P1

## Request Summary
Roadmap §12.3 milestone 1, decision 56.

Child of TCK-20261109-MILESTONE-1-KINDS-BY-PROPERTIES-EPIC.

Filed by rpg-planner on 2026-11-09 as a filing only (no code), on lead-planner-u24's go relaying the owner (#715 6731822583). This follows roadmap §12.5: "Each item becomes a ticket under the milestone 1 epic before work starts."

## Scope
1. List every decision that reads the true map to find a place.
2. Move each one to perceived, remembered or told knowledge, under the uncertainty rule (vague leads stay vague).
- Rule work before code (§12.3, "How the path runs"): the catalog text and kernel spec come first. Owner-level choices go to the owner as questions with options and a recommendation when the milestone starts. The forward design's proposed recommendations are not rulings.
- Measured as its own step, once at fold against its parent (decision 76), on the cumulative watch that restarts at v1.1, with the §12.5 per-step stop rules. Those rules and the watch are not trimmed without an owner ruling (#715 6731822583). The measurement tier is stated at dispatch under the standing depth rule (#715 6731764470). It is never below the floor (#715 6731822583): the paired default tier plus every world where an affected known entry lives. A hash-equal check alone proves only an observability change. Decision 76 (§12.3) sets a behaviour step at 3 worlds x 5 seeds x 5000 ticks per arm, and going below it needs an owner ruling.

## Out of Scope
- §12.4 (packs, herds, territory), milestones 2 and 3, and any rule work not listed in §12.3 (owner ruling only).

## Acceptance Criteria
- No place-finding decision reads the true map.
- A subject that knows no food place does not walk to one.
- Tests for the new behaviour, plus the parity ledger and Bible updates in the same change.

## Assumptions / Open Questions
- Order (roadmap §12.5, memo rows 89/93/95): the v1-disclosure repairs, then D80C, then the decision-73 step (#781, the v1.1 record), then the §12.3 items. Starting this item needs the owner's dispatch yes, brought by rpg-planner via lead-planner-u24.
- Owner-level choices are asked when the milestone starts, not guessed here.

## Implementation Notes
None yet.
